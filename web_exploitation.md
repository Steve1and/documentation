## HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

The term **hypertext** stands for text containing links to other resources and text that can be easily interpreted by the readers.
- HTTP communication consists of a client and a server.
- Default port is 80.
- **Uniform Resource Locator (URL)** example: http://admin:password@inlanefreight.com:80/dashboard.php?login=true#status
  - **Scheme**: `http://`
  - **User**: `admin:password`
  - **Host**: `inlanefreight.com`
  - **Port**: `80`
  - **Path**: `/dashboard.php`
  - **Query String**: `?login=true`
  - **Fragment**: `#status`

| Component | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Scheme | This is used to identify the protocol being accessed by the client. This is usually **http** or **https**. |
| User Info | This is an optional component that contains credentials in the form **username:password**, which is used to authenticate to the host. |
| Host | The host signifies the resource location. This can be a hostname or an IP address. A colon separates a host and port. |
| Port | URLs without a port specified point to the default port 80. If the HTTP server port isn't running on port 80, it can be specified in the URL. |
| Path | This points to the resource being accessed, which can be a file or a folder. If there is no path specified, the server returns the default index document hosted by it (for example, index.html).
| Query String | The query string is preceded by a question mark (?). This is another optional component that is used to pass information to the resource. A query string consists of a parameter and a value. In the example above, the parameter is **login**, and its **value** is true. There can be multiple parameters separated by an ampersand (&). |
| Fragments | This is processed by browsers on the client-side to locate sections within the primary resource. |

- Not all components are always required to access a resource. However, a URL should at least contain a scheme and host to make a proper request.

**Anatomy of an HTTP Request**:
1. User enters URL into browser.
2. DNS server is queried for the IP address associated with the URL.
3. The browser sends a GET request to the server on port 80, asking for the root `/` folder.
4. By default, the server will respond with an `index.html` file  with the status code `200 OK`.
5. The `index.html` file is rendered by the web browser and presented to the user.

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: a client-side language that is understood and processed by browsers. It is the standard markup language to display documents via a web browser.
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: assist HTML pages in applying presentation elements such as layout, colors, and fonts to one or multiple web pages as well as scripting languages such as **JavaScript** which enable interactive web pages.
- **Markup Language**: a system for annotating a document in a way that is visually distinguishable from the content.
***

## Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)

When this protocol is enabled, all communication between the client and the webserver are encrypted. Sites that utilize HTTPS can be identified through `https://` in the URL.
- The default port for HTTPS is 443.

**Anatomy of an HTTPS Request**:
1. User browses to http://inlanefreight.com
2. DNS server is queried for the IP address associated with the URL.
3. The server redirects the request to port 443 after receiving the request on port 80.
  - This is done via the `301 Moved Permanently` response code.
4. Next, the client sends a "client hello" packet, giving information about itself.
5. The server replies with "server hello", followed by a **key exchange**.
6. The client verifies this key and sends one of its own.
7. An encrypted handshake is initiated to verify if the encryption and transfer are working properly.
8. Once the handshake completes successfully, normal HTTP communication is continued, which is encrypted thereafter.
***

## Headers

HTTP Headers provide an additional way to pass information between a client and server. They can have one or multiple values appended after the header name and separated by a colon.
- **General Headers**: Used to describe the message rather than its contents.
  - **Date**: holds the date and time at which the message originated.
  - **Connection**: dictates if the current network connection should stay alive after the requests finishes. Usually contain either `close` or `keep-alive`.
  - **Example**:
    ```
    <SNIP>
    Date: Sun, 06 Aug 2020 08:49:37 GMT
    Connection: keep-alive
    ```
- **Entity Headers**: Used to describe the content (entity) being transferred by a message. Usually found in responses and POST or PUT requests.
  - **Content-Type**: This header is used to describe the type of resource being transferred. The value is automatically added by the browsers on the client-side and returned in the server response.
  - **Media-Type**: The `media-type` describes the data being passed. For example, the media-type for a PDF is `application/pdf`, while the type for a PNG image is `image/png`. This header can play a crucial role in making the server interpret our input. The `charset` field denotes the encoding standard, such as UTF-8.
  - **Boundary**: The `boundary` directive acts as a maker to separate content when there is more than one in the same message.
  - **Content-Length**: The `Content-Length` header holds the size of the entity being passed. This header is necessary as the server uses it to read data from the message body.
  - **Content-Encoding**: Data can undergo multiple transformations before being passed. For example, large-amounts of data can be compressed to reduce the message size. The type of encoding being used should be specified using the `Content-Encoding` header.
  - **Example**:
    ```
    <SNIP>
    Content-Length: 26012
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-4
    Content-Encoding: gzip
    ```
- **Request Headers**: Used in an HTTP request and do not relate to the content of the message. Headers such as `Accept`, `Accept-*`, and `IF-*` allow for conditional requests. Headers such as `Cookie` or `User-Agent` are sent so that the server can tailer the response.
  - **Host**: The `Host` header is used to specify the host being queried for the resource. This can be a domain name or an IP address. HTTP servers can be configured to host different websites, which are revealed based on the hostname. This makes the host header an important enumeration target.
  - **User-Agent**: The `User-Agent` header is used to describe the client requesting resources. For example, a browser or a library. This header can reveal a lot about the client, such as the browser, its version, and the operating system.
  - **Accept**: The `Accept` header describes which media types the client can understand. It can contain multiple media types separated by commas. The `*/*` value signifies all media types.
  - **Cookie**: The `Cookie` header should contain cookie-value pairs in the formate `name=value`. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning the server has no way to identify clients connecting to it. This is a problem when hosting protected resources and content. A **cookie** is a piece of data stored on the client and server, which acts as an identifier. These are passed to the server per request, thus maintaining the client's access. Cookies can also serve other purposes, such as saving user preferences or session tracking. There can be multiple cookies in a single header separated by a semi-colon.
  - **Referer**: The `Referer` header denotes where the current requests is coming from. For example, clicking a link from Google search results would make https://google.com the referer. Trusting this header can be dangerous as it can be easily manipulated, leading to unintended consequences.
  - **Authorization**: The `Authorization` HTTP header is another way for the server to identify clients. After successful authentication, the server returns a token unique to the client. Unlike cookies, tokens are stored only on the client-side and retrieved by the server per request. There are multiple types of authentication types based on the webserver and application type used.
  - **Example**:
    ```
    Host: www.inlanefreight.com
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_5) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko)
    Cookie: cookie1=298zf09hf012fh2; cookie2=u32t4o3tb3gg4
    Accept: text/plain
    Referer: https://www.hackthebox.eu/
    Authorization: BASIC cGFzc3dvcmQK
    <SNIP>
    ```
- **Response Headers**: Used in an HTTP response and don't relate to the message's content. Certain response headers such as `Age`, `Location`, and `Server` are used to provide more context about the response.
  - **Server**: The `Server` header contains information about the HTTP server, which handled the request. It can be used to gain information about the server, such as its version, and enumerate it further.
  - **Set-Cookie**: The `Set-Cookie` header contains the cookies needed for client identification. Browsers parse the cookies and store them for future requests. This header follows the same format as the `Cookie` header.
  - **WWW-Authenticate**: The `WWW-Authenticate` header notifies the client about the type of authentication required to access the requested resource.
  - **Example**:
    ```
    <SNIP>
    Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
    Set-Cookie: name1=value1,name2=value2; Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT
    WWW-Authenticate: BASIC realm="localhost"
    ```
- **Security Headers**: A class of response headers used to specify certain rules and policies to be followed by the browser while accessing the website.
  - **Content-Security-Policy**: The CSP header dictates the website's policy towards externally injected resources. This could be JavaScript code as well as script resources. This header instructs the browser to accept resources only from certain trusted domains, hence preventing access such as Cross-site scripting.
  - **Strict-Transport-Security**: The HTTP Strict Transport Security policy of a website prevents the browser from accessing the website over the plaintext HTTP protocol. All communication is done via the secure HTTPS protocol. This prevents attackers from sniffing web traffic and accessing protected information such as passwords or other sensitive data.
  - **Referrer-Policy**: This header dictates whether the browser should include the value specified via the `Referer` header or not. It can help in avoiding disclosing sensitive URLs and information while browsing the website.
  - **Example**:
    ```
    <SNIP>
    Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'
    Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000
    Referrer-Policy: origin
    ```

## HTTP Methods and Codes

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| GET | Requests a specific resource. Additional data can be passed to the server via query strings. |
| POST | Can handle multiple types of input, such as PDFs and text. This data is appended in the request body present after the headers. The POST method is commonly used when sending information (forms, logins) or uploading data to a website, such as images or documents. |
| HEAD | Requests the headers that would be returned if a GET request was made to the server. |
| PUT | Used to create new resources on the server. |
| DELETE | Lets users delete existing resources on a webserver. |
| OPTIONS | Returns information about the server, such as the methods accepted by it. |

- Response codes are used by HTTP to tell the client whether the request was sucessfully processed.

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 1xx | Usually provides information and continues processing the request. |
| 2xx | Positive response codes returned when a request succeeds. |
| 3xx | Returned when the server redirects the client. |
| 4xx | This class of codes signifies improper request from the client. For example, requesting a resource that doesn't exist or requesting a bad format. |
| 5xx | Returned when there is some problem with the HTTP server itself. |

***

## HTTP GET Method

Used to request a given resource and retrieve it.
- The header in the server's response will contain the type of *Authorization* required.
  - **Basic**: Credentials are sent via cleartext
  - **Digest**: Used MD5 to encrypt credentials.
  - **Bearer**: used to send tokens, which identify the client. Defined and created by applications and commonly associated with the **OAuth** authorization framework.
- Multiple parameter value pairs can be included when separated by an "&".
***

## HTTP POST Method

The HTTP POST method places user parameters in an HTTP Request body.
- It can accept binary data.
***

## HTTP PUT and Delete Methods

These methods are usually allowed on Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) servers. WebDAV is an extension of HTTP and is used for remote management of files and folders. It's popular in Content Management Systems (CMS) and blogging applications to enable authors to edit and upload data.
```
PUT /hello.txt HTTP/1.1
Host: inlanefreight.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Content-Length: 12

Hello World!
```

```
DELETE /hello.txt HTTP/1.1
Host: inlanefreight.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Cache-Control: max-age=0
```
***

## CURL

CURL (client URL) is a command-line tool and library which primarily supports HTTP along with many other protocols.
- **Default HTTP Requests**: `curl http://inlanefreight.com/`
- **Increased verbosity of Raw Output**: `curl http://inlanefreight.com/ -v`
- **Pass Authorization Credentials**: `curl -u admin:password http://inlanefreight.com/`
- **Follow Re-directions**: `curl -L http://inlanefreight.com/`
- **Pass data for a POST method**: `curl -d 'username=admin&password=password' -L http://inlanefreight.com/login.php`
  - Use `-v` with `-d` to follow the entire chain when passing data.
- **Specify cookie usage**: `curl -d 'username=admin&password=password' -L --cookie-jar /dev/null http://inlanefreight.com/login.php -v`
  - Specifying a filename will save cookies to the file.
  - `curl -d 'username=admin&password=password' -L --cookie-jar cookies.txt http://inlanefreight.com/login.php`
  - Use this file with the `--cookie` command to access the page directly.
  - `curl --cookie cookies.txt http://inlanefreight.com/admin/dashboard.php -v`
- **Specify Content-Type Header**: `curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ "username": "admin", "password" : "password" }' --cookie-jar /dev/null -L http://inlanefreight.com/login.php`
- **Specify a request method**: `curl -X OPTIONS http://inlanefreight.com/ -vv`
  - `curl -X PUT -d @test.txt http://inlanefreight.com/test.txt -vv`
  - `curl -X DELETE http://inlanefreight.com/test.txt -vv`

## Javascript Deobfuscation

For most webpages, HTML is used to determine the website's main fields and parameters, CSS is used to determine its design, and JavaScript is used to perform any functions necessary to run the website.
- For Firefox, press `Ctrl + U` to open the source code viewer for a webpage.
- CSS code is either defined internally within the same HTML file between `<style>` elements, or defined externally in a separate `.css` file and referenced within the HTML code in a `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">` tag.
- JavaScript can be written between `<script>` elements in an HTML file or written into a separate `.js` file and referenced with a `<script src="secret.js"></script>`.
- You can see the files referenced by clicking them in the reference links.

**Obfuscation**: A technique used to make a script more difficult to read by humans but allows it to function the same from a technical point of view, though performance may be slower.
- For example, code obfuscators often turn the code into a dictionary of all of the words and symbols used within the code and then attempt to rebuild the original code during execution by referring to each word and symbol from the dictionary.

- Test JavaScript code at: https://jsconsole.com
- Sample JavaScript: `console.log('HTP JavaScript Deobfuscation Module')`
- Code Obfuscator: http://beautifytools.com/javascript-obfuscator.php
- Advanced Code Obfuscator: https://obfuscator.io
- JavaScript Beautifier: https://prettier.io/playground/
  - Or: https://beautifier.io/
- JavaScript Deobfuscator: http://www.jsnice.org/

**Code Obfuscation Techniques**:
- **Base64**: usually used to reduce the use of special characters. Only contains alpha-numeric characters and ends with a =.
  - `echo https://www.hackthebox.eu/ | base64`
  - `echo N2gxNV8xNV9hX3MzY3IzN19tMzU1NGcz= | base64 -d`
- **Hex**: encodes each character into its hex order in the ASCII table.
  - `echo https://www.hackthebox.eu/ | xxd -p`
  - `echo 68747470733a2f2f7777772e6861636b746865626f782e65752f0a | xxd -p -r`
- **Caesar/Rot13**: shifts each letter by a fixed number. Rot13 shifts each character 13 times forward.
  - http://www would be `uggc://jjj`.
  - `echo https://www.hackthebox.eu/ | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'`
  - `echo uggcf://jjj.unpxgurobk.rh/ | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'`
